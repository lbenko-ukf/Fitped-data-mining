# Fitped-data-mining
The presented example shows the complex process that has to be done to discover knowledge from a log file. The log file comes from a web server where in this example we used a log file. The log file is in standard log file format. The source web server contained information on any logged event on a website. The results of this task will be interesting rules of behaviour of web users obtained using association analysis.

## Requirements
The log file was obtained from a university web server. This dataset has to be preprocessed and analysed using data mining methods. For this will be used the Python programming language using the Jupyter Notebook. We will require to import the pandas data analysis library for preprocessing and the MLxtend library for association analysis.
